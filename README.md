## DRY DIARY
### Got something you want to give up?
##### Start a Dry Diary to mark the days as you stop drinking, smoking - or whatever you want to quit.

You can find DRY DIARY at [drydiary.com](http://drydiary.com). If you'd like to contribute or run your own instance, clone the project and run:

    bundle install
    bundle exec unicorn
    
to start a server. You'll need to have a local instance of MongoDB up and runnning on the default port (27017).
